# Summary

This is a collection of clamps for my CNC machine. I couldn't find any good ones so I made my own in OpenSCAD.
I designed everything around using M4 bolts. It seems typical CNCs use larger bolts, but I wanted to keep mine small, since my CNC is a little smaller (MPCNC 2' x 3'). I made the SCAD file configurable for this so if you prefer to use M8 or whatever, go right ahead.
**Update* I've switched to 1/4" bolts. They're easier to find, especially at longer lengths. The STLs with QI in the name are for this size.
